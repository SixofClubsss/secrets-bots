# discord-dero-bot

This example demonstrates how to utilize the secret-discord-server's secret_pong_bot with DERO functions built in. 

Such as message components, buttons, modals and pongs to user !pings; while also demonstrating ChatGPT's helpful bot, and DERO's wallet API functionality for its permissionless, private by default, cryptocurrency.

This project is under active development, so have fun with that.
I am a terrible coder, so have fun with that.
And I really enjoyed making this project for my friends on discord...
so... have... fun.
